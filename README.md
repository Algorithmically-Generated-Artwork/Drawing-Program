# Algorithmically Generated Artwork - Drawing Program

## Introduction
We are designing and implementing algorithms that generate visual designs. These algorithms, coded in JavaScript, are built from procedural processes that draw lines and basic shapes onto an [HTML Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp). These procedural processes are inspired by mathematical concepts, natural phenomena, and artistic trends.

## Algorithm Structure
Each algorithm has two JavaScript files.  One file is for the drawing procedure and the other is for parameter configuration.  The drawing procedure is declared as a dictionary object and includes functions called *start*, *pause*, *reset*, *initialize*, and *drawOneStep*.

## Web Interface
The web interface is used to test and demonstrate the drawing algorithms.  Using the web interface, a user can start, pause, or reset a drawing algorithm.  In addition, a user can also clear the canvas and save the current state of the digital canvas as an image file.

## Algorithms
**algDots (Simple Example):** This is a sample drawing algorithm that is meant for viewers to understand the programming framework that is used to create a new drawing algorithm.  We encourage you to clone our repo and try modifying this code to build your own drawing algorithm.  If you do so, **please consider sharing your resulting artworks with us** and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/Algorithmically-Generated-Artwork/Drawing-Program/pulls)!

Example Drawing:

**algGP (Mike's Geometric Patterns):** This drawing program takes in over 30 different parameters representing line length, line thickness, rotation angles, color variations, background color blending, line sparsity, and whether intersecting lines are allowed. Based on these parameters and a random number generator, the drawing program generates different kinds of repeated geometric patterns. All of the generated patterns are drawn line by line on a digital canvas.

**algVines (Alyssa's Vines):** This algorithm, called "Vines", operates by drawing a variety of shapes across a canvas following certain kinds of paths. These paths that the vines follow are determined by various mathematical formulas. In particular, there are four kinds of paths: a random path, a linear path, a spiral path, and a path determined by a sine function.
